# Engaging the Player

Synixe has members with varying playstyles, it is important to keep this in mind
when designing a mission. The goal of this guide is to help you create a mission
that is engaging for all players.

Some members like to just show up a shoot bad guys with their friends, others
like to roleplay and immerse themselves in the mission. While some missions
will lean more towards one playstyle than the other, it is important to take
both into consideration when designing a mission.

## Investigation Missions

A mission that is solely focused on investigation and roleplay may be very
engaging for the Operation Lead and other members who enjoy that playstyle, but
it may not be very engaging for the members who are just tagging along to shoot
and aren't very involved in the investigation.

Some ways to make an investigation mission more engaging for all members:

1. Have the investigation lead to small skirmishes with the enemy, perhaps the
   enemy is trying to cover up the evidence.

2. Have enemies patrol the area, ambush the players, or have them respond to
   the players' presence. A Lamb's Hunt module can be great to have the players chased
   as they try to move through the operation area.

3. Have the investigation lead to a larger battle, perhaps the enemy is
   protecting a secret base or a cache of weapons.

4. Have a blocking force that protects the players conducting the investigation
   from being attacked while they are busy. Perhaps they are investigating
   an area but an enemy force wants to move in to disrupt and stop the
   investigation.

## Combat Missions

One the other hand, a mission that is solely focused on combat can get boring
for members who are looking for more than just a shooting gallery. 

Some ways to make a combat mission more engaging for all members:

1. Have multiple objectives that the players only have the ability to complete
   one or some of. This will force the players to make a decision and will
   create a need for information gathering and decision making.

2. Have some of the locations unknown to the players, they need to
   gather intel on the location of the enemy base before they can attack it.
   A simple puzzle can also be used to create a discussion and decision making
   process.

3. Have non-combatants in the area, perhaps the players need to protect them
   or they need to be extracted. This will create objectives that are not
   solely focused on combat.

4. Don't make the enemy force static, have them move around and respond to the
   players' actions. This will create a more dynamic battlefield and will
   force the players to adapt to the situation. Lamb's modules can be used to
   create a more dynamic battlefield.
