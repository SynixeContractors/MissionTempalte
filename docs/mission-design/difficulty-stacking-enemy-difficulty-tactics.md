# Tactics

The enemy force's "tactics" can be an important factor in the difficulty
of the mission. These are determined by the modules, scripts, and triggers
that are used in the mission. An emeny that is garriasoned in a base will
be easier to defeat than an enemy that has patrols, will un-garriason the
base when the players are detected, and will call in reinforcements when
the players are detected.
