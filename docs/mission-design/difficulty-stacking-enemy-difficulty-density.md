# Density

The density of the enemy force will have a large impact on the difficulty
of the mission. A force that is spread out will be easier to defeat than
a force that is concentrated. Having 100 enemies spread out in groups of
10 at camps around the operation area will be much easier to defeat than
having 100 enemies within a single base.
