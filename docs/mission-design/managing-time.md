# Managing Time

Time management is an important part of mission design. Considering how time
will be spent in the mission is important to ensure that the mission is
engaging for the players.

## Travel Time

Travel time is the time it takes for the players to move from one location to
another. This can be from the FOB to the AO, from one objective to another, and
back to the FOB. Travel time can be a boring part of the mission, especially at the
start and end of the mission.

Travel time can be managed by:

- Keeping the first objective close to the FOB
- Keeping the objectives relatively close to each other
- Keeping the last objective close to the FOB

## Avoiding the Long Drive Back

At the end of the missions, the players will want to get back to the FOB,
do debrief, and log off. Having a long drive back to the FOB can be a boring
end to the mission, and cause a rushed debrief. Having players dead and in
spectator makes this drive even more of a chore.

To avoid this, you can have the player extract from the AO when appropriate.

If you have multiple objectives you can lay them out in a way that the players
are moving back towards the FOB as they complete the objectives.

```text
| C      B |
|          |
|          |
| D      A |
|          |
|      F   |
```

In the example above, the players leaving from the FOB (F) will move towards
objective A, then B, then C, then D, and then back to the FOB. The objectives are
laid out so that the players are moving back towards the FOB as they complete the
mission, and the drive back to the FOB is not as long as if the objectives
progressively moved away from the FOB.

### Back Up Vehicles

If the players have lost vehicles during the mission, espeically near the end,
it can be a problem with getting everyone back to the FOB. Remember, the
enemies have vehicles too, they needed to get there somehow! Having some vehicles
at enemy locations is great for preventing this problem, and is realistic too.
