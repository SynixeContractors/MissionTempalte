# Terrain

Terrain choice can have a significant impact on the difficulty of a mission.

The types of buildings, foliage, and density of those objects will influence
the kind of mission that can be created, and the options the players have
available to them.

The affect of terrain can vary depending on the mission objectives.

Camps in the open are easier to assault than those in dense forests. But a
heavily fortified base in the open is harder to assault than one in a dense
forest, as the defenders have more time to see & react to the attackers.

After selecting the locations for your objectives, you should consider their
surroundings and stack other elements of difficulty accordingly.
