# Composition

The composition of the enemy force will have a large impact on the difficulty
of the mission. A force that is composed of infantry will be easier to defeat
than a force that has access to armored vehicles.

A group of 4 infantry on their own, or a lone .50 cal technical, will be
much more easily defeated than a group of 4 infantry with a .50 cal technical
supporting them. The players will need to prioritize the .50 cal technical
and will need to react quickly to it.

#### Squad Size

The size of the enemy squads will have a impact on their ability to share
informcation and move around the battlefield. Small groups of AI are more
able to move around the battlefield and react to the players' actions quickly
and efficiently. Larger groups of AI are less able to move around as they
try to stick together, but will be able to share information more easily.
Informing each other of the players' locations.

#### Squad Composition

Make note of the enemy squad's composition. Enemy squads with a diverse
composition will be able to react to the players' actions more easily.
Marksmen, automatic riflemen, and grenadiers will allow the enemy squad
to be more effective in a wider variety of situations. A squad of 4 diverse
AI can be more effective than a squad of 8 riflemen in some situations.
