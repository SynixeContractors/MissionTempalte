# Weather

Weather can be a big influence on the difficulty of a mission. Varying levels
of adverse weather can be a good way to increase the difficulty without
requiring a lot of work.

## Random Weather

By default, the weather in the mission is random, but influenced by the location
and date of the mission. Leaving the weather unchanged is fine for most missions,
as it won't ever be too bad and increase the difficulty too much.

## Setting the Weather

When you do want to make an easier or harder mission, you can set the weather
to be more or less adverse. Adding rain or fog will reduce the players' ability
to see and / or hear the enemy.

You can set the mission to start clear and worsen over time, or start bad and
improve over time, depending on the type of mission you are making.

## Keeping it Realistic and Reasonable

It is important to keep the weather realistic and reasonable. Arma does
not play well when the weather is too bad. Very heavy fog is unreasonable
and will make the mission for frustrating than fun. Certain mission types
are also not suited for adverse weather, such as search and rescue,
finding something hidden, or getting ambushed. In reality, missions
would be postponed if the weather was too bad.
