# Indexicality

Indexicality is the way we can communicate things indirectly to your players,
albeit this relies a lot more on intuition rather than conditioning. What this
means is that players won't have a "cause-and-effect" learning experience to
advice what could happen.

Resorting to this will rely heavily on the players' previous baggage and outside
experiences, let alone the experiences they've had previously with the game, while
not being entirely contained within your mission.

An index is a sign which is related to the object it represents, but not directly
or in a concrete way.

To put this simply, smoke cannot exist without fire, but it is not fire. The
presence of smoke lets us know, indirectly, that there is a fire nearby.

Following this same logic, if we have some knowledge of previous missions, real
life events, in-game universe lore, and even our users' backgrounds, it would be
possible to try and put together things we know they might expect.

If players are sent out on a mission to rescue a crashed down helicopter, smoke
is a good indicator of where there is fire, indicating where there is likely a
crash. If players are trying to find and locate enemies within a region, finding
their vehicles or some supply caches around might indicate that they either are,
or have been, nearby. A siren alarm after players raid a base or attack a location
is not an enemy attack in of itself, but it indicates that it is likely for
reinforcements to come and respond to the threat.

This entails taking on a lot of assumptions about your players, and the above are
very explicit examples. However, with proper thought, you can find your own ways
of communicating with the players entirely through your mission alone, which the
players may or may not catch.
