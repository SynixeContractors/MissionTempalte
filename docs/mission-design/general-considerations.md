# General Considerations

## Making Dynamic Missions

### Empathy

When you want to make a mission that will engage players and allow them to creatively solve problems, you should generally avoid thinking linearly. The first step in order to do this is trying to get into the other faction's mind, and ask yourself: "how would I do this?"

```admonish info
In general design, no matter the field, empathy is an important aspect of it. Thinking about the players, or about the enemy faction, is a great way to ensure a mission's design is consistent and realistic.
```

Imagine you set up a group of OPFOR to defend a location but this location has many entrances, aside from the front door, there's gaps in the wall, there's a back entrance, maybe there's a forest nearby. These are all things that a competent enemy would think about when setting up an efficient defense for a position, unless you purposely want to depict the enemy force as incompetent.

In this case, you can add a patrol outside and around the compound. Maybe a guy or two guarding the gaps. This will account for different ways players could possibly take on this objective, instead of just one.

Try to get in the enemy faction's mind and think to yourself how would you utilise the resources you have to complete a task, whether it is an attack, an ambush, or the defense of an important strategical keypoint.

```admonish info
It is nearly impossible to always know all of the ways players could possibly take on an objective, let alone how a mission is going to play out. Accounting for this kind of variability is a key sign to a thoughtfully made mission.
```

### Indexicality

Another interesting thing we can keep in mind is the use of indexicality. Players are often trying to put a puzzle together when playing missions, and sometimes, if we can foresee this we can condition the way they will play, succeed, or fail, our mission.

```admonish info
An index is a sign which is related to the object it represents, but not directly or in a concrete way.
```

To put this simply, smoke cannot exist without fire, but it is not fire. The presence of smoke lets us know, indirectly, that there is a fire nearby.

If players are often finding IEDs in trash bags, that is going to turn into the 'implicit language' of the mission: trash bags have IEDs! If enemy garrisons always have a campfire nearby, they are going to start associating that as a mechanic within the mission: enempy encampments all have campfires! If all red cars are smuggling weapons... you know how it goes!

This is generally a hit or miss, depending how explicit, how often and how long your mission is, not to mention how attentive players are being, but this is a subtle resource you can use to control your mission and guide players indirectly.
