# Conditioning

An interesting thing we can keep in mind is the use of conditioning. Players are
often trying to put a puzzle together when playing missions based on the
cause-and-effect of their playthrough, and sometimes, if we can foresee this,
we can condition the way they will play, succeed, or fail, your mission.

If players are often finding IEDs in trash bags, that is going to turn into the
'implicit language' of the mission: trash bags have IEDs! If enemy garrisons
always have a campfire nearby, they are going to start associating that as a
mechanic within the mission: enempy encampments all have campfires! Players will
go through a 'lessons learned' experience contained within your mission.

Classical conditioning is the act of learning through association. It is a cycle
of understanding a cause-and-effect.

This is generally a hit or miss, depending how explicit, how often and how long
your mission is, not to mention how attentive players are being, but this is a
subtle resource you can use to control your mission and guide players indirectly.
