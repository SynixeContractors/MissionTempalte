# Equipment

## Infantry

The enemy infantry's equipment will determine how hard they are to defeat.
An ememy force with body armor, helmets, and high quality weapons will be
harder to defeat than an enemy force with carrier rigs, head scarfs, and low
quality weapons.

## Vehicles

The enemy vehicles' equipment will determine how hard they are to defeat.

Simple vehicles can be used to quickly bring in reinforcements, potentially
before the players have had a chance to deal with the current encounter.

Armed vehicles can be used to create a more challenging encounter for
the players. A vehicle with a 50 cal machine gun will be high priority
target for the players that they will need to react quickly to.

Armored vehicles are the most difficult to defeat. They will likely
require the players to use anti-tank weapons or explosives to defeat.
They should be used sparingly as they can easily overwhelm the players.
